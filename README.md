## Meetings

### Schedule and Cadence

Regular steering committee meetings will be held, at least once per month. 

The entire steering committee is generally expected to attend every meeting, but quorum is met with 3/5 attendance.

## Projects

### Initial Charter

This document will define how the committee is to manage the project until it has transitioned to an elected steering body, as well as what governance must be in place. 

A charter should cover all of the following topics:
* Scope of rights and responsibilities explicitly held by the steering committee
* Committee structure that meets the requirements above
* Committee decision-making process, including for changes to the charter
* Election process, including:
  * Who is eligible to run as a candidate
  * How candidates are nominated
  * Special elections in the case someone resigns or is impeached
  * Voter registration and requirements
  * Committee company representation quotas
 * How are meetings conducted
    * Frequency and duration
    * How is meeting information shared
    * Are meetings recorded
    * How is work tracked (eg, steering project board)
    * Member note taker, or a neutral facilitator role that exists outside of the committee
