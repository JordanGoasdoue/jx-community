# â›© Testing and Platform Integration Special Interest Group

## Goals
* One of the initial tasks of the SIG will be to determine its objectives.
* Some suggestions for testing: 
    * testing + linting at the minimum (logging/instrumentation could be considered, but initially we need focus)
    * Improve documentation around writing tests
    * Add a test coverage report
    * Add unit tests to begin with
    * Look into integration tests once unit tests are working
    * make it easier for new contributors to write tests - hopefully, improvement will be a by-product of adding the above
    * Improve existing tests, some of them seem to be not unit tests, but depend on external factors
    * helper libraries - common helper functions can be part of that package, there is already one which exists, but could be improved

## Leadership

The Chair of the SIG, with agreement from Members, will run operations and processes governing the SIG. He/she will also establish and decommission subprojects.

Proposed Chair: TBD
