# Jenkins X Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) meeting Aug 23rd 2023

## Participants

- Tom Hobson
- MÃ¥rten Svantesson 

## Minutes

+ Tom is looking at switching to ESO for external secrets
+ We brainstormed about the how to solve problems with quickstarts / pipeline catalog packs
    + Quickstarts are not maintaned, especially because changes need to be tested manually
    + It is hard to support different language versions of packs, especially in combination with other tools used (for example gradle / maven) since you need to create a separate for each variety
    + Somehow we would need pipelines to be composable while keeping ease of use
    + We need to keep this in mind when continuing the work of removing support for the `image: uses:` syntax for reuse.
