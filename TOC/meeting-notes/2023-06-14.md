# Jenkins X Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) meeting June 14th 2023

## Participants

- Mårten Svantesson
- Tom Hobson

## Minutes

- Kubernetes 1.25
  - Upgrade Tekton
  - Deadlock in release process
      - It's not possible to upgrade components one by one to support k8s 1.25. Instead we are working on a manual PR with all needed changes.
      - https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-versions/pull/3643 
  - Rollout plan
    - We want to release the support for Kubernetes 1.25 as quickly as possible, but make it easy to do the necessary changes in application and cluster repositories
    - Tom and his team will create a tool to convert the pipelines referred to in the source configs for a dev cluster
    - Mårten will verify that downgrading the cluster will work, especially with regard to tekton pipelines
    - For those having enabled automatic upgrades we don't have a good solution
    - Mårten will add support in `jx gitops upgrade` for showing release notes
