## Participants

- Mårten Svantesson
- Ankit Mohapatra
- Rajat Gupta
- Christoffer Vig


## Minutes

- [Action items](https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-x/projects/21/views/1)
  - We have got credits in AWS
- Detecting new cluster [#876](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-gitops/pull/876)
  - Nobody had any suggestions on better detection of new cluster
- Handling multirepo changes
  - To be able to review features and fixes that require changes to multiple repositories the design
    should be described in an enhancement proposal
- Propagation of change logs
  - The suggestion from Mårten about propagating changelogs in pull requests where met with
    approval. But a enhancement proposal should be created.
- jx v. jx-boot images
  - There are (at least) 2 base images with commonly used tools used in the Jenkins X project:
    - https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-cli-base-image/blob/master/Dockerfile
    - https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/blob/main/Dockerfile-boot
  - An action item to investigate if there is a need for both should be created
  - If both base images are still needed they should be aligned. In that case one should be the base
    of the other.
