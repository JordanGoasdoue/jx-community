## Initial Tasks for the TOC
These tasks were discussed during the Jenkins X Community Summit in Austin, June 9 2022
The TOC should 
- Coordinate with [CDF TOC](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc), and pick a representative to the CDF TOC
- Pick maintainers from regular contributors, using some predefined rules  and regulations
- Handle costs and budgets - Do we need a finance team for this in the future?
- Elect chairman and referee for the TOC (use bot for random selection each time?)
- Set up LF open collective if someone wants to donate to Jenkins X maintainers
- Should have Maintainers + representatives from the end user community
- The TOC needs to handle all points listed under the "Initial charter" section below

## Projects

### Initial Charter

This document will define how the committee is to manage the project until it has transitioned to an elected TOC, as well as what governance must be in place. 

A charter should cover all of the following topics:
* Scope of rights and responsibilities explicitly held by the TOC
* TOC structure
* Committee decision-making process, including changes to the charter
* How are meetings conducted
   * Frequency and duration
   * How is meeting information shared
   * How is work tracked (eg, steering project board)
   * Member note taker, or a neutral facilitator role that exists outside of the committee
* Election process, including:
   * Who is eligible to run as a candidate
   * How candidates are nominated
   * Special elections in the case someone resigns or is impeached
   * Voter registration and requirements
   * Committee company representation quotas
